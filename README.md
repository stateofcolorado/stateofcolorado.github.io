  <h2>Discovery</h2>
  <h4><p>The Chernobyl disaster is commonly known as the most catastrophic nuclear accident in history. At the heart of the disaster site lies perhaps the most dangerous object on earth, dubbed "The Elephant's Foot" for its resemblance to an elephant's foot. Around eight months after the calamity, workers who entered the maintence corridors around the remains of the No. 4 Reactor  discovered a large black mass that seemed to be flowing out from the reactor. They were informed from their sensors that the mass was so radioactive, that even just being exposed to it for five minutes could be fatal. Most photographs only capture a small portion of the massive conglomoration of toxic material.</p></h4>
  
  <h2>Origin</h2>
  <h4><p>On April 26th, 1986, near the Belarus Boarder in Ukraine, a disaster occured while trying to run an experiment on the No. 4 Reactor at 7% of its power. Workers removed power control measures and allowed the reactor to continue running. As a result of several mistakes, a large chain reaction caused the core to go haywire. Due to the several explosions that ensued, the heavy steel lid of the containment building was blown off, causing large amounts of toxic material and radiation to be released into the environment. By May 4th, workers were actively trying to contain the spill, at great risk to their own health. During the tragedy, people were evacuated starting from 36 hours after the initial meltdown. Around 200,000 people were evacuated in the following weeks and even months.</p></h4>
  
  <h2>Composition</h2>
  <h4><p>The Elephant's Foot's black and wrinkled appearance is given to it by the several materials it consists of. The mass is composed of corium, a substance produced when nuclear fuel and parts of the reactor's core fuse together. Corium has only been produced a total of five times in history. It consists of silicon dioxide and various other oxides, mostly uranium, iron, zirconium, calcium, aluminum, potassium, and magnesium. The accumulation is quite dense and it was necessary to use weapons such as AK47s to break off pieces of it to sample and study. The accumulation has. been slowly weakening. As of 2021, according to Radiation Measurements, the Elephant's Foot has been described with the consistency of sand.</p></h4>
