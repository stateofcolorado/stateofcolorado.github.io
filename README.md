  <h2>Discovery</h2>
  <h4><p>The Chernobyl disaster is commonly known as the most catastrophic nuclear accident in history. At the heart of the disaster site lies perhaps the most dangerous object on earth, dubbed "The Elephant's Foot" for its resemblance to an elephant's foot. Around eight months after the calamity, workers who entered the maintence corridors around the remains of the No. 4 Reactor  discovered a large black mass in the basement that seemed to be flowing out from the reactor. Despite this, it had hardened by the time it was discovered. They were informed from their sensors that the mass was so radioactive, that even just being exposed to it for five minutes could be fatal. Most photographs only capture a small portion of the massive conglomoration of toxic material.</p></h4>
  
  <h2>Background</h2>
  <h4><p>On April 26, 1986, near the Belarus border in Ukraine, a disaster occurred during a safety test on the No. 4 Reactor at dangerously low power levels. Workers disabled important safety systems, leading to a chain reaction that caused the reactor core to go out of control. Two massive explosions followed, blowing off the massive steel lid of the reactor and releasing radioactive material into the environment. By May 4th, workers were still working to contain the radiation, putting their lives at great risk. Evacuations of nearby areas began 36 hours after the meltdown, and over 200,000 people were displaced in the following weeks and months.</p></h4>

  <h2>Composition</h2>
  <h4><p>The Elephant's Foot's black, wrinkled appearance comes from the various materials it consists of. This mass is primarily made of corium, a substance formed when nuclear fuel melts and fuses with parts of the reactor's core. Corium, which has only been produced a handful of times in history, contains silicon dioxide and various oxides, including uranium, iron, zirconium, calcium, aluminum, potassium, and magnesium. The mass was so dense that weapons like AK-47s were used to break off pieces for sampling and study. Over time, the accumulation has weakened. As of 2021, according to Radiation Measurements, the Elephant's Foot has been described as having the consistency of sand.</p></h4>
  
  <h2>Radioactivity</h2>
  <h4><p>Upon discovery, the Elephant's Foot emitted around 8,000-10,000 roentgens per hour. This staggering level of radiation was primarily due to the presence of highly radioactive isotopes created during the Chernobyl disaster. As of today, its radioactivity has significantly decreased, yet it remains extremely lethal. Caesium-137, Strontium-90, and Iodine-131 are a few of the crucial radioactive isotopes produced during the nuclear fission. While the first two have astoundingly long half lives of nearly 30 years, Iodine-131's half life is comparatively shorter at eight days. However, these isotopes can still be extremely dangerous, increasing the risk of different diseases, especially cancer. Caesium-137 is especially concerning due to its solubility in water. Strontium-90 is able to embed itself in bones, increasing the risk of bone cancer and leukemia while Iodine-131 can  increase the changes of getting thyroid cancer.</p></h4>
  
  <h2>Today</h2>
  <h4><p>Today, the Elephant's Foot stands as a chilling reminder of the Chernobyl disaster's consequences. While its threat has decreased significantly since 1986, it remains extremely dangerous, requiring continued monitoring. It serves as a symbol of the risks associated with nuclear power and a stark reminder of the importance of safety measures.</p></h4>
